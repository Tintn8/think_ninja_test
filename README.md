# think_ninja_test

A new Flutter project.
Built in VsCode. 

Requires flutter tools to run.

Tested on pixel 6

## Getting Started

Workflow is so =>

On the home screen , open the navigation drawer.
Here is a list of available pages.
Menu will take you to a page that will allow you to enter menu items for the restaurant.
You can add a name of an item and a price. The items will show below in a list. Clicking on a item in the list will delete it from the menu.

From here the waiter can proceed to requests where the menu items are displayed and can be added along with a table number and any special requests for the customer. Waiter must add a Table number and quantity of items. Each item is added seperately.
The list below will populate with the current entries. Click an item to delete it from the request.

Once satisfied with the request. The waitor can move to orders where there draft is saved. From here they can either: edit the request, delete the request or push through to the kitchen.

The kitchen staff can then view all the details of the order and start preparation. The item is now from Draft to In Progress.
The staff once completing the order can push its status through to awaiting collection where it will be removed from the kitchen backorder.

Waitors can then check the Awaiting collection page where they will see a list of orders waiting to be deliverd to customers.
The status will change from Waiting collection to completed once the waiter recieves and delivers it. It will then be removed and added to the database under pastOrders.

Will attempt the bonus challenge if possible before a demonstration. 

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards
Tristan
